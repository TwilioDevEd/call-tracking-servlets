## Quickstart

### Create a TwiML App

This project is configured to use a **TwiML App**, which allows us to easily set
the voice URLs for all Twilio phone numbers we purchase in this app.

Create a new TwiML app at https://www.twilio.com/user/account/apps/add and use
its `Sid` as the `TWIML_APPLICATION_SID` environment variable wherever you run
this app.
